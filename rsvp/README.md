rsvp
====

* *“Really Simple Varnish Panel”*
* This WebApp allows you to monitor your Varnish server.
* This app uses cool new stuff such as [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [TwitterBootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) but also very ugly old ones such as [CGI](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/cgi.html). Why? Because it was the easiest way!
* **Do not use on production server. Use for testing purpose only**

Features
--------
* Display real-time **varnishstat** with *HIT/(HIT+MISS)* ratio
* Display real-time **varnishlog**
* **Ban** every URL from cache
* **Restart** Varnish cache

Installing rsvp
---------------


* Obviously, you need a **Vanish cache server** (version **3**) up and running.
* You need **Apache** running on the same server, different ip port, let's say 81, but anyone will do.
* You need Apache to be able to connect to **varnishadm**, so copy */etc/varnish/secret* to */etc/varnish/secret.www-data* and chown it to *www-data:www-data*.
* I strongly suggest that you protect your server with some **authentification** (.htpasswd with Basic AuthType should be enough).
* **Copy** rsvp directory to */var/*, *www-data* should have **write** access to */var/rsvp/www/logs/* directory.
* You need also to know how to create an Apache **VHOST**. That's about it.
